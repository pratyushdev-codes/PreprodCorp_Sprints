## Item-based Collaborative Filtering in Python

This prompt.md file outlines the Python code for building an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system. 

**Objective:** Recommend movies to users based on their past ratings and the ratings of similar movies by other users.

**Data:**

* `u.data`: Contains user ratings for movies (user_id, item_id, rating, timestamp).
* `Movie_Titles.csv`: Lists movie titles corresponding to item IDs in `u.data`.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * Import libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `warnings`).
    * Read the datasets with appropriate delimiters and column names.
    * Merge the datasets to include movie titles.
    * Explore the data (dimensions, descriptive statistics).

2. **Data Exploration:**
    * Calculate average ratings and number of ratings per movie.
    * Visualize the relationship between ratings and number of ratings using jointplot.

3. **Creating User-Item Interaction Matrix (UII):**
    * Pivot the data to create a user-item matrix (user IDs as rows, movie titles as columns, and ratings as values).

4. **Identifying Similar Movies:**
    * Use a sample movie (e.g., "Fargo (1996)") as a reference.
    * Calculate the correlation coefficient between the ratings of "Fargo" and all other movies in the UII matrix.

5. **Filtering Recommendations:**
    * Set a minimum threshold for the number of ratings a movie needs to be considered for recommendation.
    * Join the correlation data with the number of ratings per movie.
    * Recommend movies with high correlation and sufficient ratings ("number_of_ratings" > threshold).

6. **Next Steps:**
    * The code provides a framework for item-based recommendations.
    * This can be extended to recommend movies to a specific user based on their past ratings. 
    * Consider implementing user-based collaborative filtering for a different approach.

**Additional Notes:**

* Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different thresholds and correlation measures. 
* Remember to replace the file paths with the locations of your datasets.
