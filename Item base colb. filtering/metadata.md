**Author:** Pratyush Birole

**Date:** 14 Oct 2024

**Description:**

This document provides metadata for the Python code implementing an item-based collaborative filtering recommender system for movies.

**Keywords:**

* Recommender Systems
* Collaborative Filtering
* Item-Based
* User-Item Interaction Matrix
* Correlation
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy

**Languages:**

* Python

**Libraries:**

* pandas
* numpy

**Datasets:**

* `u.data`: User ratings for movies (user_id, item_id, rating, timestamp)
* `Movie_Titles.csv`: Lists movie titles corresponding to item IDs in `u.data`

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x (with pandas and numpy installed)

**Output:**

* This code identifies movies similar to a chosen reference movie based on user ratings. It recommends movies with high correlation and sufficient user ratings.

**Additional Notes:**

* This code provides a basic framework for item-based recommendations. It can be extended for user-based recommendations or incorporating additional features.
* Feel free to adapt the code for different datasets or recommendation scenarios.

**Disclaimer:**

This code is for educational purposes only. The datasets might have limitations or biases.
